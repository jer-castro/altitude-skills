# Altitude — copy/paste edition

Don't want to install the skill pack? These prompts walk the same method, step by step — just copy, paste, and go. The skills are still the fuller experience (they carry the whole method so you don't have to), but these will take you most of the way.

Three things before you start:

1. **Work in one project folder.** Make an empty folder for your project and always start your coding agent inside it.
2. **The prompts save your progress to files** in a `learning/` folder — plain markdown you own. That's how a brand-new session picks up exactly where the last one left off. Don't skip those parts.
3. **Answer quizzes in your own words.** If your agent turns a quiz into a multiple-choice panel, tell it to ask in plain chat instead — picking from a list isn't the same as retrieving it yourself, and the right option is usually guessable.

Works with Claude Code, Cursor, or Codex — any coding agent that can read and write files in your folder.

---

## Step 1 — Get set up with a coding agent

No prompt needed — this step is about setup. Get a subscription to a real coding agent (Claude Code, Cursor, or Codex — skip the vibe-coding app builders), install it, and learn just enough to get moving: context and context management, memory, model selection, plan mode, skills. An evening or two. If you want a guided tour, paste this:

```
I'm brand new to this coding agent. Give me a short, practical tour of just the
fundamentals I need to get started: what context is and how to manage it, memory,
model selection, plan mode, and skills. One at a time, with a tiny hands-on
exercise for each. Don't try to teach me everything — just enough to start.
```

## Step 2 — Pick your project (plant the tree)

Pick something you actually want to exist — a daily or weekly annoyance software could remove. If nothing comes to mind, have the AI interview you:

```
Hello — I'm looking for ideas for a project we can build together, as a way to
learn to code for real. My current experience with building software: [describe
honestly — "none", "a few spreadsheet formulas", "some HTML years ago"].
Interview me about my life — my work, my routines, my hobbies, anything I do
repeatedly that software could streamline. Ask one question at a time and wait
for my answer. Then pitch me 2–3 project ideas sized for my level: challenging
but not overwhelming, with something visible working early. Steer me away from
first-project traps like marketplaces, payments, real-time/multiplayer apps, or
anything that's only useful if other people show up for it.
```

## Step 3 — Define the MVP

```
Help me define the MVP for this project — the minimal version that is actually
usable, live on the internet, not a demo on my laptop. Split every feature we've
talked about into two lists: "In the MVP" (the smallest set that makes it
genuinely useful end to end) and "Parking lot (v2)" (everything else, written
down so it stops nagging me). Push back if I try to sneak extra features into
the MVP. Then create a file called learning/project.md recording who I am and my
experience level, the project idea, and both lists — every future session will
start by reading that file.
```

## Step 4 — Build the trunk

```
Read learning/project.md. What are the fundamental core components of this
project that I will need to learn and build in order to deploy it end to end?
Assume I know nothing about engineering or coding — define every term in plain
language the first time you use it. Don't go deep into the details: just lay out
the major pieces (roughly 5–9), with a high-level explanation of what each piece
is and why this project needs it. I want to follow engineering best practices
from day one, including source control. Once you've laid them out, check my
understanding: have me explain one or two of the pieces back in my own words.
Then add this trunk to learning/project.md.
```

Read through the result carefully. This is the trunk — the foundation every branch and leaf will attach to.

## Step 5 — Build the branches

```
Read learning/project.md. Help me come up with a plan to build this project with
learning as the primary objective — speed of delivery is not the goal here,
understanding is. First, walk me through every design decision this project
needs (language, frontend, backend, database, hosting) one at a time: recommend
the popular, common, boring choice — the one with the biggest community and the
most beginner documentation — name 1–2 alternatives with the real tradeoff in a
sentence or two, and check that I can say in my own words why the recommendation
fits before locking it in. Then structure the build as 5–9 sections, each ending
in a concrete deliverable I can see working, sequenced so each layer builds
naturally on the last — for a web app: a basic page rendering, then styling and
interactivity, then a simple local server, then APIs, then a database, then the
core features, then tests, then live deployment. Sections only — no task-level
breakdown yet. Save the locked decisions and the sectioned plan to
learning/plan.md. The goal: by the end of this project I should be able to
explain how my app works end to end.
```

## Step 6 — Define the leaves

```
Read learning/project.md and learning/plan.md. Create my living knowledge graph
at learning/knowledge-graph.md — the map of what I actually know. It gets
updated after every lesson, and it's the thing that decides what I get quizzed
on. Seed one entry per concept this project will teach me, biased toward
system-story concepts (how pieces fit) and machine-level concepts (why the
computer stops being magic at this stack's scale — process vs disk, request vs
response, ports, isolation). Include syntax/API "glue" leaves only when they're
load-bearing for a later check. Still span the full range: structural (files
talking to each other, dependencies, package manifests), engineering practice
(git commits, testing, environment variables), and AI-era practice (writing a
good plan, reviewing a diff, agent memory files). Each entry gets a status —
seed (not yet taught) → introduced (explained once) → practicing (used it with
help) → understood (explained in my own words and passed a quiz on a later day)
— plus an optional altitude tag (system | glue | machine), introduced/last-reviewed
dates and a one-line evidence field. Statuses only ever upgrade on evidence of
something I actually said or did, and I shouldn't be re-quizzed on concepts that
are understood and fresh. Anything we already walked through and checked while
planning starts as introduced, not seed. Also create learning/file-map.md — a
map of every file and folder in the project, one line each on what it is and why
it exists, marked known (I explained it in my own words), parked (honest
one-liner for now, deep dive scheduled), or generated (machine-made, never
edit). Nothing in my repo should ever be a mystery box. Start it with the
learning/ files themselves.
```

Steps 2–6 take an hour or two with the AI's help. Now the tire meets the road.

## Step 7 — Follow the plan, one task at a time

This is the prompt you'll reuse every session, for months. Take it slow — one task per sitting. The pause between lessons is part of the method.

```
Read learning/plan.md, learning/knowledge-graph.md, and learning/file-map.md,
then let's execute the next task — just that one task; I'll come back for the
next one. If the current section isn't broken into tasks yet, break this section
only into 3–7 small tasks, each ending in something I can see working, and add
them to the plan as checkboxes. If anything on disk isn't accounted for in the
file map, tour it or park it with an honest one-liner before we build. Then
teach as you go: before each chunk of code, explain in plain language what it
does and why it's there. Take really small steps — never dump a big block of
code on me. Leave 1–3 blanks marked "TODO(you)" in the actual file for me to
fill in my editor, then read what I really saved and respond to my real code.
Before running any new code or command, ask me to predict what will happen — and
when my prediction is wrong, slow down and dig into the gap, because that's
where the learning is. When a command creates new files (scaffolds, installers),
walk me through the 4–6 that matter in plain language and park the rest in the
file map — never build on files I can't account for. Quiz me on graph concepts
as they come up — prefer questions about how pieces fit or what the machine is
doing ("walk the path from input to result," "what breaks if we delete this,"
"why does this survive a restart") over pure syntax recall — always open
questions I answer in my own words, never multiple choice — but never re-quiz
what's marked understood and fresh. At the
end: update learning/knowledge-graph.md (statuses upgrade only on evidence of
what I actually did; optionally tag new leaves altitude: system | glue | machine,
no backfill) and learning/file-map.md (files I authored count as known),
check the task off in learning/plan.md, give me a one-line recap of the new
leaves on my tree, and stop there. If I arrive wanting to build something
that's not in the plan, don't refuse and don't just build it: help me place it
— promote it from the parking lot or add a new section sized like the others —
be honest about what it depends on and what moves later if it jumps the queue,
then teach it the same way as everything else.
```

## Already have a project? — the adoption path

Built something already — maybe an AI wrote most of it — and you can't fully explain it? Don't start over. These three prompts replace Steps 2–6; run them in your existing project folder, in order, each in its own session if you like (the files they write are the save points). Then the Step 7 prompt works unchanged.

**Adoption 1 — Triage:**

```
I already have a project — [one sentence: what it is and how it got built, e.g.
"an AI coding tool built most of it" or "I followed a tutorial partway"]. I want
to actually understand it and keep building it, not start over. First look
around: the file listing, package.json, the README, and git status — tell me
plainly if git isn't even set up — and check whether the app currently runs.
If you have memory or notes about this project from past sessions, treat them
as leads, not facts: verify anything you rely on against the repo as it is
today before writing it down.
Then interview me one question at a time: what the app is in my own words, how
it was built and how much I typed myself, what works and what's broken, which
parts of the code scare me most, and what I want it to become. Then give me
your honest triage recommendation with the reasoning shown: adopt it as-is;
trim first (of everything built, which features are actually my MVP? — freeze
the rest, don't delete them); or, only if it can't be made to run or the stack
is a genuinely bad teacher for a beginner, rebuild with this repo kept open as
the reference spec. This is an inventory, not an exam — no shame anywhere.
Record who I am, how the app was built, the MVP / frozen / parking-lot split,
and the decision in learning/project.md.
```

**Adoption 2 — The understanding inventory:**

```
Read learning/project.md. Now build my honest understanding inventory. First
probe what I actually know with 5-8 questions anchored to MY code — open
questions I answer in my own words, never multiple choice — one spot
per layer (a UI piece, a server route, wherever data gets saved, one config
file), biased toward the parts that scare me — asking things like "walk me
through what happens when I click save" and "what breaks if this line is
deleted?" My claims don't count as evidence, only what I demonstrate; if I say
I wrote something, probe it once before believing me. Then create
learning/file-map.md covering everything on disk, one line each on why it
exists: known only for what I explained myself, generated for machine-made
folders like node_modules, and parked with an honest one-liner for everything
else — expect mostly parked, that's the point, every parked line is a lesson
we've scheduled. Walk me through the 4-6 files that matter most in plain
language. Then create learning/knowledge-graph.md seeded with one entry per
concept this codebase embodies plus the engineering practices it's missing
(git, testing, environment variables), biased toward system-story and
machine-level concepts; include glue/syntax leaves only when load-bearing.
Each entry gets a status — seed (not yet taught) → introduced (explained
once) → practicing (used it with help) → understood (explained in my own
words and passed a quiz on a later day) — plus an optional altitude tag
(system | glue | machine), dates, and a one-line evidence field. My probe
answers set the statuses; everything unprobed starts at seed. Do not
backfill altitude on leaves you are not creating today.
```

**Adoption 3 — The forward plan:**

```
Read learning/project.md, learning/file-map.md, and learning/knowledge-graph.md.
First walk me through the decisions my code already made — language, framework,
database, hosting — one at a time: what each is in plain language, whether it's
the popular boring choice or an unusual one (be honest), and check I can say
what it does for my app before moving on. Then write learning/plan.md. Section
1 is always "make the ground solid": the app runs on my machine, git exists
with a baseline commit, and the learning folder is committed — my project can
never be lost again. The remaining sections are my unbuilt MVP features in
order of value, 5-9 sections total, each ending in something I can see working.
If my MVP is already fully built, don't invent a backlog from what you find
lying around — ask me what I want to build next, and offer anything unfinished
you found (branches, open PRs, old plans) as candidates, after checking each
is still current: a branch or PR remembered as open may already be merged.
Note next to every section where its work came from.
Give every section exactly one reclaim task: pick a parked file or a fuzzy
inherited decision that section's feature touches, and the task is to explain
it, break it on purpose, predict the failure, then fix it. Put the missing
engineering practices (tests, deployment) where they become load-bearing, not
tacked on the end. Sections only — no task breakdown yet.
```

## Extras — for when real life happens

**When you broke something.** You will. It's a gift, not a detour:

```
I changed something on my own and now it's broken. Before you fix anything, show
me how to see what I changed — git status and git diff, read together in plain
language — and ask me for one prediction about why it broke before revealing the
cause. If my change shows a reasonable instinct, help me finish what I was
trying to do rather than undoing my work. Let me type the fix. Afterwards, add
what this taught me to learning/knowledge-graph.md and suggest committing the
repair.
```

**Weekly review.** Memory fades on a schedule; review on one too:

```
Read learning/knowledge-graph.md. Quiz me on 3–5 concepts I haven't reviewed in
over a week, one question at a time — open questions I answer in my own words,
never multiple choice. Update last-reviewed dates on passes. If I
struggle, downgrade understood to practicing — no shame, forgetting is how
memory works, that's why we review — and give me a 2–3 sentence refresher. End
with one repo-tour question from learning/file-map.md: pick a file and ask me
what it's for.
```

**The one mistake.** The pull to say "just write the whole thing" is real — the AI *could* generate it all in a minute. That's passenger mode, and it's the one mistake that makes learning with AI worse than tutorials ever were. When you feel it, paste this instead of giving in:

```
I'm feeling the pull to just have you write everything for me. Remind me in one
paragraph what I'd be trading away, then let's do this one task with fewer
check-ins — but not zero. Understanding checks scale down; they don't turn off.
```

---

**Never ship a line of code you can't explain.**

Want the full experience instead of carrying these prompts around? The [skill pack](README.md) bakes all of this in — install once, then it's just `/start-project`, `/plan-journey`, and `/next-lesson`.
